### Introduction

HopeBucket ("the App") is a daily gratitude and hope journaling app developed by Sarah Rettig. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how the App handles your information.

### Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information.**

The App does not require you to create an account, log in, or provide any personal details such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.

### Locally Stored Data

The only data the App stores is:

- **Hope list entries**: The text you enter as your daily hope items.
- **Date tracking**: The current date, used to reset your list daily.

This data is stored **exclusively on your device** using local storage (AsyncStorage). It is never transmitted to any external server, cloud service, or third party.

### Data Sharing

**We do not share any data with third parties.**

Since the App does not collect or transmit any data, there is nothing to share. Your hope list entries remain entirely on your device.

### Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, tracking, or crash reporting services.

The App contains a link to [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com), an external website. If you choose to follow this link, you will leave the App and be subject to Pixabay's own privacy policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of external websites.

### Clipboard Access

The App includes a feature that allows you to copy your hope list to your device's clipboard for sharing purposes. This action is initiated only by you and does not transmit any data externally.

### Data Security

Because all data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted over the internet, your information is protected by your device's built-in security measures (such as device passcode, biometric authentication, and encryption).

### Data Retention and Deletion

Your hope list data is stored on your device until:

- The App is uninstalled, which removes all locally stored data.
- The daily reset clears your list at midnight each day (the previous day's entries are replaced).

You have full control over your data at all times.

### Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since no personal data is collected, the App is suitable for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
